# pagerank
An Pyspark implementation of PageRank without using the built-in function. This program runs in Spark 2.4.5 and also requires GraphFrames to be installed. This program was developed and tested on Databricks.

Input data is from US flight records. The program assigns a rank to each airport and then displays the top 10 highest ranked.
